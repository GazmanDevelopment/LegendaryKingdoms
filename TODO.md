# Things To Do
Below are some things I still need to work on if I get the time.  For the moment, it's working to the point I can use it for my own playthrough so really, that is all I am interested in right now.  

- ~~Create SQL config and initialisation script for items other than ion_auth~~
- ~~Finalise reCaptcha checking~~
- ~~Add Fleet support~~
- ~~Add Battlefield Support~~
- Fix ordering of codes
- ~~Add spell management~~
- Check security - users can only view / edit items in their assigned parties
- Standardise naming conventions
- Standardise function calls
- Flesh out the ion_auth code to allow for registrations, activations, password resets etc
- Review visual elements to see if there are better ways to visualise the data, especially the character sheets
- Review all error handling code.  Ideally standardise dialogs and make use of CodeIgniters built-in message passing
- Allow for Parties to be assigned to multiple users
- Improve database handling - return "affected rows" instead of standard result of update / insert / delete queries
- Enable self-registration
- More things I can't think of right now but will come to me!
